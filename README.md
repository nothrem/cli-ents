# cli-ents
**Collection of Windows Console Scripts that offer GUI for CLI applications.**

There are lots of useful tools on Github and internet in general (such as ffmpeg
to name at least one), but most of these tools are console applications (CLI) that
require user to open console or terminal and write parameters.

This can be extra hard for Windows users who are used to using Drag&Drop and GUIs.

This set of Windows Console scripts offers help in using these tools by providing simple Drag&Drop and GUI-like environment.

_These scripts are provided under Create Commons Zero licence but please note that they need the tools which can and will have their own licenses!_

## For developers

To fork and checkout this repository, it is recommended to configure your GIT
to "Checkout as-is, commit as-is" and then configure your editor or IDE project
to save files with Windows-style line endings (i.e. CRLF). Windows Console may
have problems with processing scripts that use Unix-like or Mac-like line endings.
