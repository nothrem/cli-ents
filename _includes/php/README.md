Scripts in this folder are written in PHP and compiled by PHC (https://github.com/jaredallard/phc-win/releases/tag/v2.0.1).

When compiling scripts in PHC, use the option UPX which will compress the code and produce smaller EXE file.

EXE files in this folder should not be used because they need the php*.dll to run. You should instead used the EXE files in `bin` because they are stand-alone executables.
